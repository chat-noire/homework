            <h2>Disco</h2>
            <p>It is a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the late 1960s from the United States'
                urban nightlife scene. Its sound is typified by four-on-the-floor beats, syncopated basslines, string
                sections, brass and horns, electric piano, synthesizers, and electric rhythm guitars.<br>Discoth√®ques as
                a venue were mostly a French invention, imported to the United States with the opening of Le Club, a
                members-only restaurant and nightclub located at 416 East 55th Street in Manhattan, by French expatriate
                Olivier Coquelin, on New Year's Eve 1960.</p>

        <h2>Rock</h2>
        <p>Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated as "rock and roll" in the United States in the late
            1940s
            and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles from the mid-1960s, particularly in the United
            States and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the genres
            of
            blues, rhythm and blues, and country music. Rock also drew strongly from genres such as electric blues and
            folk,
            and incorporated influences from jazz and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock is centered on the
            electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers.
            Usually, rock is song-based music with a 4.</p>

            often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or
            political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the Western world from the 1950s
            to            the 2010s.</p>

        <h2>Classical</h2>
        <p>Music generally refers to the art music of the Western world, considered to be distinct from Western
            folk music or popular music traditions. It is sometimes distinguished as Western classical music, as the
            term
            "classical music" can also be applied to non-Western art musics. Classical music is often characterized by
            formality and complexity in its musical form and harmonic organization,[1] particularly with the use of
            polyphony.[2] Since at least the ninth century it has been primarily a written tradition:
        <ul><li>notational system</li>
            <li>iterature in analytical</li>
            <li>historiographical,</li>
        </ul>
        musicological and philosophical practices. A foundational component of Western culture, classical music is
        frequently seen from the perspective of individual or groups of composers, whose compositions, personalities and
        beliefs have fundamentally shaped its history.</p>
